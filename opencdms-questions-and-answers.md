# OpenCDMS Project and OpenWIS Association

## Questions and thoughts

### What is the benefit of OpenCDMS to the Association?

- The scope of OpenCDMS Project is complementary to the OpenWIS project, especially through the WIGOS metadata standard.
- Further convergence between synoptic and climatological observation data is likely in a “cloud-first” environment.
- The Association has an aim to adopt further Open-Source projects
- Together, OpenWIS and OpenCDMS would be a good base for further projects, especially in WMO Services, and including hydrology and agro-met.

### What is the nature of support sought from the Association and resources needed?

- Ownership, assurance
- a reporting structure and access to advice on open-source techniques to be used, 
- use of the Contributor License Agreement system. 
- OpenCDMS Project will not expect funds from the Association as funding sources are becoming available, 
- but there may be circumstances where the Association can usefully act as an umbrella to receive and disburse funds for the Project.

### What are the proposed next steps once a decision has been made and time-scale?

- Set up the Project Management Committee
- Implement use of the Contributor License Agreement
- Agree the OSI and Creative Commons licenses to be used.
- Bring in predecessor systems, either as contributing groups or under software archiving. These systems will probably include Climsoft, MCH and CliDE; archived systems may include HYDATA, CLICOM.
- Data model development in 2020/21
- Aim is to have a working installable OpenCDMS by 2023, useable in a small to medium NMHS with the minimum essential capability.

### Risks and mitigation

- OpenCDMS Project gets insufficient funding. Initial funding is likely to be mainly through development aid projects where the main focus is on delivering systems into developing country NMHS, with a proportion for software development. This is dependant on being able to deliver credible systems with the assurance of sustainability and future improvements. Delivering the full vision would need commitment by at least one developed NMHS for its own use.
- Inability to get a wide range of contributors, especially those with expertise in other systems, including both proprietary and bespoke. Mitigation is to keep close to WMO and its Expert Teams.
- Competition from other projects and programmes. Mitigation is to emphasise inter-operability, peer review of methods and open-source.
